# Gamify goal management with Goal Supremo!

>## The idea:
>> ### Every big skill is a slow refinement of its smaller subskills
> 
> This app tries to organise and visualise this methodical process of learning by allowing users to represent each big skill with an infinitely growing object, **subdivided over various subskills.** To grow a big skill, **users must create and complete tasks that target at most 2 subskills.**
>
> **So why 2?** The goal of this app is to promote a slow, methodical approach to learning and reward users for following this methodology. This means being patient with one's personal development and also being more accountable for the steps taken for their growth.
>
> Thus, there are **4 major components** of this app.
> 1. **Task scheduling(WIP).** There are 3 views to be implemented, including a view of all tasks(WIP), tasks for the day(WIP) and tasks in a calendar view(WIP). Tasks have basic CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality(WIP). Each task can target at most subskills of the same skill(WIP).
> 2. **Task timer(WIP).** To handle starting a task. Users may start tasks at any time and the timer helps less disciplined users from getting distracted within the set duration of the task.
> 3. **Skill view(WIP).** Skills are represented by an evolving visual(WIP) and subskills which are tags tied to a numerical score relating to how many half-hour tasks were dedicated to them(WIP). Users can search through their skills(WIP).
> 4. **Detailed skill view(WIP).** For users to view their progress on their skill, represented by a progressively evolving visual graphic.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
